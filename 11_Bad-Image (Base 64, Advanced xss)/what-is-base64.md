<h1>What is base 64</h1>

<h4>
Base64 is a encoding algorithm that allows you to transform any characters into an alphabet which consists of Latin letters, digits, plus, and slash. Thanks to it, you can convert Chinese characters, emoji, and even images into a “readable” string, which can be saved or transferred anywhere.
