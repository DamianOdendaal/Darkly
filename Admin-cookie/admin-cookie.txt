Fourth flag already, seems like you guys are having fun

Step 1: On the landing page inspect the element

Step 2: Go to application and then cookies,  in there we will find the i_am_admin cookie with the value --> 68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327

Step 3: decrypt value using MD5 to get this --> false

Step 4: Change the false to true,  so encrypt True with MD5 hash then replace the first value with our new hashed value 

Step 5: refresh the page 

Well done we have our fourth flag
