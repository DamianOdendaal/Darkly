Many people are not aware that images can be inlined into html code.
The method in which this is done is called base64 encoding.
Base64 encoded images become part of the html and displays without loading anything instead of a web browser having to download the image


Step 1.) go to http://192.168.1.100/index.php?page=media?src=nsa
    once you are here you can change the value of source then see the sorry wrong answer indicating we on the right track


Step 2.) Tried to change nsa to <script>alert("Working")</script>,  no luck there so we convert the same script into base 64

Step 3.)  Replace nsa with the base 64 encoded string

Note for Step 3
'''
    Something to keep in mind ,  because we are putting a base 64 string into the href attribute we are going to need to 
    add something too so that it will work 

    according to https://base64.guru/developers/html/link

    it would look like this with the encoded string 

    data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnVGhpcyB3b3JrcycpPC9zY3JpcHQ+

    now replace nsa with the abovementioned string to get the flag

'''

Well done we found another flag
