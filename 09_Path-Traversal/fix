1.)  Make sure the server process can only access the directories it needs.
     Consider running the process in a chroot jail if you are running on Unix. 
    This will mitigate the risks if a directory traversal vulnerability is discovered.

2.) Sanitise filename parameters
    The safest approach is to restrict filenames to a list of known good characters,
     and ensure that any references to files use only those characters.
