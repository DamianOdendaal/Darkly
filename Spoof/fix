How to Prevent an IP Spoofing Attack
Ensuring that all IP addresses present on your network are legitimate can be a tall task but it is manageable. Dealing with IP spoofing attacks is reliant upon making a number of key changes to your day-to-day operations:

--Use an access control list – An access control list allows you to deny private IP addresses
     from interacting with your network. This will prevent many attacks from getting off the ground.


--Packet Filtering – Packet filtering keeps coming up but is one of the best ways to control what traffic
 is permitted on your network. By filtering traffic you can block traffic from suspicious sources.


--Authentication – Authenticating interactions between devices on your network will help to make 
    sure that nothing has been spoofed.


--Change Router and Switch Configurations – Configure your routers and switches to reject incoming 
    packets from outside of the local network which are spoofing an internal origination.
