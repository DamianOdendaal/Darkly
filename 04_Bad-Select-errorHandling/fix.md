<h1>Here we can see that the data that comes in from the client does not get sanitised before its used or sent to the server</h1>

<h4>A better way to have done this was have the values inside an array or list, so that when we get the data we can compare it with data that we are actually supposed to be using. In a case of the data not being inside your "allowed array" then the appropriate error message will just be returned. This can be done on the client and the server side of the application</h4>
