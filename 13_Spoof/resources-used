A HTTP request may include a 'referer' field (yes it is misspelled),
which can be used to tell from which URL the client got to this particular resource.
Some programs/scripts check the referer field of requests to verify that this wasn't arriving from an external 
site or an unknown page. While this is a stupid way to check something so easily forged, many scripts still do it.
Using curl, you can put anything you want in the referer-field and thus more easily be able to fool the server into serving your request.

Use curl to set the referer field with:

curl --referer http://www.example.come http://www.example.com
