A project that will help us understand the OWASP top ten
(https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

The project is like a game where we capture 14 flags,  we are going to have a lot of fun breaking the site

Interesting things learned during this project

<ol>
<li> What a robot.txt file is </li>
<li> SQL injection more in depth </li>
<li> XSS more in depth </li>
<li> brute force password cracking </li> 
<li> How dangerous it is not to sanitize data before using it </li>
<li> What a shadow file is on a unix system </li>
<li> What directory/file traversal is </li>
 </ol>
