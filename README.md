# Darkly
Dodo the hacker has awakened

A project that will help us understand the OWASP top ten
(https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

The project is like a game where we capture 14 flags,  we are going to have a lot of fun breaking the site

Interesting things learned during this project

1.)  What a robot.txt file is 
2.) SQL injection more in depth 
3.) XSS more in depth 
4.) brute force password cracking 
5.) How dangerous it is not to sanitize data before using it 
6.) What a shadow file is on a unix system

Got Help on Brute Force from Frederick Moor
