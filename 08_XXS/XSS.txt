Think we starting to lose count of all these flags
Flag 7

Step 1: go to http://192.168.1.100/index.php?page=feedback

Step 2.) Inside any of the fields add html markup to see if instructions are executed,  example <b>Oh</b>
--> in doing this you see that the instruction is executed and we can now go deeper

Step 3.) Trying <script> alert("it works") </script> will only keep the  alert("it works") part and not the tags

Step 4.) <body onload="alert("it works")"> will insert the alert but not produce flag

Step to get flag.)  In messing around,  inside the name or the comment field you can put any characters from the words
alert or script,  but they must be in order,  the whole word need not be there for the flag to appear


Well done thats the 8th flag
