Step 1.)   go to any page on the site and replace the pages value inside the query string to '../'

Step 2.) In doing this you see the friendly alert that says 'wtf',  try to branch further down by doing '../../'

Step 3.) When we keep traversing further the alerts keep changing indicating we are getting close.
        --> When we see the 'You are getting close' stop there and add '/etc/passwd/' to the end of all the '../../'


      Side Note:  --> The sequence ../ is valid within a file path, and means to step up one level in the directory structure.
        The three consecutive ../ sequences step up from /var/www/images/ to the filesystem root, and so the file that is actually read is: /etc/passwd

Step 4.) Get the flag


Well done on finding the directory Traversal flag
